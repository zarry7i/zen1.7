## General Information
This project is a Python-based AI Voice Assistant that can be used on your PC. The assistant uses speech recognition and natural language processing to understand your commands and respond to them accordingly. You can use it to perform various tasks, such as opening applications, searching the web, and even controlling your smart home devices.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in this project:
- Python
- SpeechRecognition library
- pyaudio library
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library
- pywhatkit library
- wikipedia library

## Requirements
Before you can use this AI Voice Assistant, you will need to make sure you have the following installed on your computer:
- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition
- PyAudio
- pyttsx3
- pywhatkit
- wikipedia
- pyjokes
- pytemperature
- PyAutoGUI
- psutil
- pywebio
You can install these packages using pip. For example, to install SpeechRecognition, you would run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
`pip install SpeechRecognition`

## Features
The AI Voice Assistant has the following features:
- Voice recognition: The assistant can recognize your voice and respond to your commands.
- Natural language processing: The assistant uses NLP to understand your commands and respond accordingly.
- Web search: The assistant can perform web searches for you.
- Play music: The assistant can play music for you using the pywhatkit library.
- Open applications: The assistant can open applications such as Google Chrome, Visual Studio Code, and Microsoft Word.
- Control smart home devices: The assistant can control smart home devices such as smart bulbs and smart switches.

## Setup
To set up the AI Voice Assistant, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the `main.py` file in your terminal.
To use the AI Voice Assistant, simply download or clone the repository from GitHub. Then, navigate to the directory where you saved the files and run the following command:
`python main.py`
This will start the AI Voice Assistant. You can then start giving commands by speaking into your computer's microphone.

## Usage
To use the AI Voice Assistant, run the `main.py` file and say "Zen" followed by your command. Here are some example commands you can use:
- "What is the weather like today?"
- "Tell me a joke"
- "Open Google"
- "What is the time?"
You can also add your own custom commands by modifying the `command()` function in the `main.py` file.

## Contributing
